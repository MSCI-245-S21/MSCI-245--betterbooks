#betterbooks

This is the app that can user create their favorite books. Multiple users can upload multiple books. 

There are three sections on page, **Authors**, **Books**, **Users**. 

Authors, Books, Users can be created, edited, and delted in the /authors, /books, and /users page. 

To create a **new book**, information about title, author's name, Year of publication, genre (fiction/non-fiction) are needed. 

To add a **new user**, user name and email are needed. Email cannot be duplicated with others. 

Modify the app to allow books to be sorted by genre (fiction/non-fiction) in the same manner that user can sort books by author, title, and year by clicking on the table header for that column in the /books page. 

The default order should be that fiction books are listed first, and then non-fiction books.
